# Final Project: Chatting with Friends

## Purpose

This program features a messaging platform that allows a user to communicate with other users on the DS platform. The platform supports saving and loading dsu profiles so users are capable of adding other users and exchanging messages with them. Added contacts and past conversations on dsu profiles are automatically to support future use of said profiles. The use of a graphical user interface also allows for ease of navigation.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the latest version of Python currently installed. If not, here is a [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to do so. Ensure that your machine is able to run IDLE or another IDE, such as VS Code, and access python programs.

## Installation

To install, please download ds_messenger.py, user_interface.py, ds_protocol.py, and Profile.py to your machine, preferably all in an easy-to-reach folder. Make sure that the contents of these files are saved as python files, marked at the end with a ".py".
